#description

A high-performance Go rewrite I developed to replace the Python-based TFUtils project, dramatically improving speed and
usability for TFBern students while showcasing my expertise in creating efficient, cross-platform software solutions.

# TFUtils-Go

## Project Overview

TFUtils-Go represents my solution to performance and usability bottlenecks in the TFUtils project at TFBern. By
completely rewriting this tool in Go, I am creating a significantly faster, more reliable alternative with
simplified deployment across all platforms.

## The Challenge

As a student at TFBern, I noticed many struggles and limitations with the original Python-based TFUtils:

- Slow execution for complex project tasks
- Complicated and unreliable build process
- Only supported on windows
- Maintenance difficulties
- SFTP speed issues

## My Solution

Leveraging my expertise in Go programming, I developed TFUtils-Go to address these pain points:

- **Lightning-Fast Performance**: Replaced interpreted Python code with compiled Go for dramatically improved speed
- **Single-Binary Deployment**: Eliminated dependency headaches with Go's self-contained executables
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Implemented robust error handling and leveraged Go's strong type system
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensured consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Current Status

TFUtils-Go is in early alpha development, with core functionality implemented and testing underway. I'm actively working
on expanding features while gathering feedback from early adopters at TFBern.

## Looking Forward

My roadmap for TFUtils-Go includes:

- Complete feature parity with the original TFUtils
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Improved UI/UX for a more intuitive user experience
- Speed optimizations and performance tuning
- Real usage at TFBern
